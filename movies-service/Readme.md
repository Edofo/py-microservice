# Mon API Microservice

This is a simple FastAPI-based microservice project organized with controllers and services for creating RESTful APIs. It demonstrates a basic structure that you can use as a starting point for building microservices.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

microservices/
├── app/
│ ├── init.py
│ ├── main.py
│ ├── controllers/
│ │ ├── init.py
│ │ ├── movies.py
│ ├── services/
│ │ ├── init.py
│ │ ├── movies.py
├── requirements.txt
├── Dockerfile

Copy code

-   `app/` contains the main application code.
-   `controllers/` folder contains controllers responsible for handling HTTP requests.
-   `services/` folder contains services that encapsulate business logic.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Build the Docker image:
    bash
    Copy code
    docker build -t mon-api-microservice .
    Run the Docker container:
    bash
    Copy code
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 mon-api-microservice
    You can now access your API at http://localhost:8000/endpoint.
    ```

## Usage

### Controllers/Services

Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests, perform request validation, and delegate business logic to services.

Services contain business logic and interact with the data layer if needed.

## Testing

You can create unit tests for your services and integration tests for your controllers to ensure the functionality of your microservice.

## Deployment

For deploying multiple microservices and managing them, consider using container orchestration tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
